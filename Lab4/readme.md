# Pre-Lab
IDEA GENERATION: The point of this week's lab is to figure out a cool interaction that you can make possible with the a micro controller which can record data generated by a sensor, and then play it back.  You could make programmable piano. You could make that records how much you toss and turn at night. You could make something that measures the changing light levels in your room. 

# Data Logger (and using cool sensors!)

For this lab, we will be experimenting with a variety of sensors, sending the data to the Arduino serial monitor, writing data to the EEPROM of the Arduino, and then playing the data back.

## In The Report

## Part A.  Writing to the Serial Monitor
 
**a. Based on the readings from the serial monitor, what is the range of the analog values being read?**

0 to 1023

**b. How many bits of resolution does the analog to digital converter (ADC) on the Arduino have** (hint: where might you look to find this sort of thing)?

The Arduino could map the input voltage (0 to 3.3V / 5V) to integers between 0-1023. 2^*10*=1024, which requires a 0-bit analog to digital converter. This information could be found on the spec sheet.

The serial monitor currently shows values between 0-512. Hence, there are 9 ADCs in use.

You can also read inputs from the serial monitor, or wait for the serial monitor to open before spewing data over the USB line! A nice tutorial on the basic serial transmit functions can be found at http://arduino.cc/en/Tutorial/AnalogReadSerial. 

NEW!!! Also you can plot the data with the Arduino Serial Plotter! This can be found under `Tools->Serial Plotter`. Try it out.
 
For this lab, you can use the serial monitor, plotter and/or the LCD whenever you are told to display something, depending on what you think is easier/prettier.

## Part B. RGB LED

## Part C. Resistance & Voltage Varying Sensors 
 

### FSR

**a. What voltage values do you see from your force sensor?**

The code maps the force values between 0-255 (256=2^8). The maximum value the display shows is 249. This is equivalent to roughly 996/1023, which is almost 5V. 

**b. What kind of relationship does the voltage have as a function of the force applied? (e.g., linear?)**

Resistance and force are directly related (that is, when one increases - so does the other and vice versa). However, that relation ship is NOT linear.
In addition, voltage is inversely proportional to resistance because of the voltage divider (the more resistance we produce - the more current directed the other route). 
Mathematical relationship: Vo = Vcc*(R/(R+R_FSR))
That is, voltage varies inversely to resistance - logarithmically.

**c. In `Examples->Basic->Fading` the RGB LED values range from 0-255. What do you have to do so that you get the full range of output voltages from the RGB LED when using your FSR to change the LED color?**

Yes This could be accomplished using the map() function. In the code linked [here](https://github.com/OiBoii/Interactive-Lab-Hub/blob/master/Lab4/mapFSR_LED.ino)
 component of the RGB led to demonstrade the code for simplicity. The link to the code can be found below.


**a. What resistance do you need to have in series to get a reasonable range of voltages from each sensor?**

**b. What kind of relationship does the resistance have as a function of stimulus? (e.g., linear?)**

Control the colors of the LED using the above sensors ( including FSR )

## Part D. I2C Sensors 

Some more sophisticated sensors have ICs that measure physical phenomena and then output an digital signal indicating what the analog voltage reading is. 
### Accelerometer
 
The accelerometer is a 3-axis, accelerometer based on the LIS3DH. The LIS3DH is a 3.3V part, but the Adafruit board has an onboard voltage regulator so that the part can be powered on 5V power on the Vin pin.
 
Here's the [Datasheet](https://cdn-shop.adafruit.com/datasheets/LIS3DH.pdf)
 
Unlike the other parts we've used to date, this is a "smart sensor" which can communicate the sensor readings digitally (rather than through an analog voltage) using communication protocols I2C and SPI. 
 
[This example code](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-lis3dh-triple-axis-accelerometer-breakout/arduino) is meant to read values from a 3-axis accelerometer out to a computer over the serial monitor. Test it out! Hint: make sure to read the I2C Wiring section carefully, because the picture uses a different kind of Arduino. Here's a Fritzing diagram of the correct wiring:

https://github.com/FAR-Lab/Interactive-Lab-Hub/tree/master/Lab4/LIS3DH_breadboard.JPG

Adapt the code to indicate what your readings are on the X, Y and Z axes of the accelerometer on your 16x2 LCD panel.

Now set up the RGB LED so that each color is mapped to the X, Y and Z axes accelerations.
 
Get a feel for the data the accelerometer provides. Pick up the Arduino+accelerometer board and tilt it in various directions. Start by holding it so that the accelerometer board is parallel to the ground. Find in which direction the X reading increases and decreases; do the same for the Y reading.
 
**a. Include your accelerometer read-out code in your write-up.**


## Part E. Logging values to the EEPROM and reading them back
 
### 1. Reading and writing values to the Arduino EEPROM
The sample code in `File->Examples->EEPROM` shows functions from the [Arduino EEPROM Library](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Reference/EEPROM) to write and read values to Arduino's EEPROM. This [modified version of the SwitchState code](https://github.com/FAR-Lab/Interactive-Lab-Hub/tree/master/Lab4/SwitchState) employs these functions in three different states. Try it out.

**a. Does it matter what actions are assigned to which state? Why?**

**b. Why is the code here all in the setup() functions and not in the loop() functions?**

Each character in the string is a byte. That is, it takes 8-bits to encode a character, so the number of characters in the string we are writing is the number of bytes we are occupying in EEPROM. The [Atmega 328P](https://www.microchip.com/wwwproducts/en/atmega328p) at the heart of the Arduino has 1024 bytes of internal [EEPROM](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EEPROM) Memory (which is separate from the 32KB of [Program memory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Read-only_memory) it has for the code it is running.)

**c. How many byte-sized data samples can you store on the Atmega328?**

**d. How would you get analog data from the Arduino analog pins to be byte-sized? How about analog data from the I2C devices?**

**e. Alternately, how would we store the data if it were bigger than a byte? (hint: take a look at the [EEPROMPut](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Reference/EEPROMPut) example)**

Modify the code to take in analog values from your sensors and print them back out to the Arduino Serial Monitor.

### 2. Design your logger
You've been thinking at a high level about a data logger and what it is used for; now you need to adapt that to the specific implementation. 


A lot of the art of data logging is being clever about how to use the sensor. Feel free to engage the teaching team for advice.

Your data logger will have two main modes: one where it logs data and another where it plays the data back. Think a little about what sensors you would like to log data from and how you would like to display your data. Create a state diagram sketch that indicates how you'd like to switch between one mode and the other, and also what you'd like the program to do in each state. This can help you decide what buttons or knobs might be useful for your design.
 
You might make changes to your design before this lab is complete.
 
**a. Turn in a copy of your final state diagram.**

## Part G. Create your own data logger!
Now it's up to you to integrate the software and hardware necessary to interface with your data logger! Your logger should be able to record a stream of analog data (at a sample rate of your desire) and then play it back at some later point in time on your display of choice.
 
**a. Record and upload a short demo video of your logger in action.**
