# Staging Interaction

In the original stage production of Peter Pan, Tinker Bell was represented by a darting light created by a small handheld mirror off-stage, reflecting a little circle of light from a powerful lamp. Tinkerbell communicates her presence through this light to the other characters. See more info [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tinker_Bell). 

There is no actor that plays Tinkerbell--her existence in the play comes from the interactions that the other characters have with her.



For lab this week, we draw on this and other inspirations from theatre to stage interactions with a device where the main mode of display/output for the interactive device you are designing is lighting. We plot the interaction with a storyboard, and use our computer and a smartphone to experiment with what the interactions will look and feel like.


## Prep

### For lab, we need:

1. Paper
1. Markers & Pen
1. Smart Phone--Main required feature is that the phone should be able to connect to Zoom, which will be used to project the images.
1. Computer--The computer is used to broadcast the videos which will be projected using our device.
1. OHP Sheet, Scotch Tape, Scissors, Ruler--we costume our phone so that it looks like some other device.

### Deliverables for this lab are: 
1. Storyboard
1. Sketches/photos of costumed device
1. Any reflections you have on the process.
1. Video sketch of the prototyped interaction.

## Part A. Plan

_Setting:_ Our player, Levi, has been working from home due to the pandemic that has taken the world by storm. While he has set up a perfect workspace to keep his productivity high, the number of emails/IMs he has to engage in frustrates him. As a result, he tends to rush through them often, and ends up misrepresenting his sentiments behind the messages.

_Players:_ Levi is the primary player in our setting, who is struggling how to effectively communicate with his colleagues and clients. His colleagues and clients are secondary players who will benefit if he is more cogent with his words.

_Activity:_ **HoloSent** (Hologram + Sentiment) comes with a browser extension which Levi installs on his computer. Now, all of Levi’s messages are promptly evaluated by this device, the colour projections of which identify the sentiment conveyed by his messages. When Levi notices a mismatch between his emotion and the colour on HoloSent, he knows he should rephrase his message.

_Goals:_ The “Work From Home” shift has caused every person to rely more heavily on emails/written messages as opposed to physical meetings as the primary mode of communication. As we navigate this new normal, it is imperative that we convey sentiments/emotions clearly through written messages in order to build/maintain lasting relationships. 

**HoloSent** can detect the sentiment conveyed by your messages in real-time, thereby guiding you to communicate more effectively. Through its different colours, it expresses the tone of your message (Red-Angry,Rude, Blue-Calm, Green-Happy/Interested, White-Professional). This is particularly useful when the tone does not match your intention, allowing you to fix the message and be more adept in your communication skills.

A storyboard of the interactions can be seen below.
<p align="center"><img src="https://github.com/singhaniasnigdha/Interactive-Lab-Hub/blob/Spring2021/Lab%201/StoryBoard.png" width="840"></p>

On presenting the original idea to others, the following feedback was obtained:
* Some found it to be a very interesting and useful device. Miscommunication is so frequent between parties, and this tool can help resolve some issues in that domain.
* Some were concerned if users would be comfortable allowing a machine read/record their personal messages for analysis.

## Part B. Act out the Interaction

We attempted to physically act out the interaction that were planned. Our thoughts and reflections from this exercise are documented below.

Some things that seemed better on paper and when ideating were:
* Size of the projected images - As the projected images are tiny (given that we're using a smartphone), the device needs to be strategically placed to be viewed clearly. Instead, if we use a tablet and make a bigger pyramid, the images will be more distinct.
* Filming - Filming the device appeared to be an obstacle that was not accounted for. It is challenging to capture the action and the device together, particularly because the current HoloSent can be viewed from specific angles. 

Some new ideas that popped up when the team was acting out the interaction were:
* Use as reminders - Sync with reminders on your cell phone, and use some key images from the description to remind the user when its time for their activity (example - the picture of a dumbbells when its time to head to the gym)
* Use to represent the weather outside
* Use different colors and images to be representative of the music playing around


## Part C. Prototype the device

Our smartphone is used as a stand-in for the device we are prototyping. We will not be using "Tinkerbelle" for our prototype. Instead, we use Zoom, where the screen shared from the laptop is rendered on the phone. The Pyramid is placed at the center of the phone screen and projects the images from the shared screen. The user can then control what colours or images are displayed by remotely monitoring the display from their laptop.

The steps to create the prototype are summarised below.

The final paper prototype of our pyramid can be seen below. We shade opposite sides red and green to denote the sentiment conveyed by the user.

## Part E. Costume the device

We create a DIY 3D Pyramid Hologram using an OHP Sheet, clear tape and a pair of scissors. This [tutorial](https://www.instructables.com/DIY-Pyramid-Hologram/) is used for inspiration. 

The pyramid looked like this.
<p align="center"><img src="https://github.com/singhaniasnigdha/Interactive-Lab-Hub/blob/Spring2021/Lab%201/Hologram-Pyramid.png" width="320"></p>

The pandemic is one of the primary reasons this idea was thought of. The hologram beside one's computer could work both as a decorative piece with a purpose. 

As HoloSent will usually be placed close to your laptop/other device that you want to analyse the messages from. While there is a risk of water ruining the device, the other gadgets that are likely in its vicinity are not water-proof either. The purpose of the HoloSent it to just be an additional buddy to our overworked users, hence it does not have any emergency requirements. The idea of using a hologram as opposed to the smartphone screen to communicate using light appeared interesting, which is why I went ahead with this approach.

## Part F. Record

A video of the interaction with the **HoloSent** prototype is shown below.

#### Acknowledgement
Samantha Lee (snl48) and Shivani Doshi (sgd73) collaborated with me to brainstorm, record and provide feedback on this lab. Critical feedback included:
* Inappropriate Lighting - The Holograms projected by the Pyramid can be viewed the best in a relatively dark room. We should explore how we can make the images more pronounced during daytime.
* Explore more emotions - For this video, we focussed on positive and negative emotions only. It was suggested that we can also look at other sentiments and explore more creative options to convey the meaning of the analysis.

# Staging Interaction, Part 2 

## Feedback from classmates
Bebe Lu (bl643) said:
> I love how you dressed your phone! How did you achieve the dusty particle-like effect? That is unreal!
      Somehow the overarching idea is really heartwarming to me, showing and keeping a positive and kind energy to the world. I really wish there is a way to show semantics for text messages too. For email, a somewhat formal communication, I personally tend to be more careful about how I phrase things. With text messages and personal exchanges, I really hope to know if I am sending out a negative vibe (especially with intimate relationships).

Erin Gong's (yg545) reaction was:
> I really like your idea of detecting tones of written messages and how you costumed your device! The color choices also match the sentiment conveyed by the message – red being angry, blue being calm, etc. so that the user doesn’t have to remember what each color represents. This might become a problem if you are going to add more emotions to the device. But if light is not a requirement, I think a voice output can allow more emotion options and is more intuitive.

Anam Tahir (at884) had some insightful feedback on how the use case of the device could be modified to indicate how busy a person was:
> Liked the over arching idea, and especially the smart use of pyramid to prototype! Something that I was confused about was why would I need a separate device when the indication could be on screen too. Thinking about that gave me some possible use cases ideas that could be considered in the next iteration.
For example, during wfh it often happens you are in a meeting and people are passing behind or coming in the room and talking to you not realizing you are un-muted so maybe the device can serve as an indicator for people around you regarding how busy you are.

Some useful thoughts shared by Sam Lee (snl48) were:
> The setting is a little difficult since it has to be dark for you to see the hologram clearly. Most of the time I’m working, I’m not sitting in the dark.
> Does the HoloSent always listen to what you’re typing? Or can you tell it to review? If so, can you show how you told it to review your work?

## Updates
The idea from Part 1 is built upon to replace colors with animated emoticons that can more accurately represent the sentiment. Erin's feedback to accomodate more distinct indicators for different emotions combined with some voice prompt was used as inspiration for this feature. 

This is the updated story board for HoloSent:
<p align="center"><img src="https://github.com/singhaniasnigdha/Interactive-Lab-Hub/blob/Spring2021/Lab%201/StoryBoard_2.png" width="840"></p>

The set up for the interaction video is identical to what was used earlier (in part 1). We hosted a Zoom meeting, and shared the screen allowing the laptop to control the images/videos showing up in the Hologram. We also transmitted voice through the call, that conveyed the errors or sentiments associated with those emoticons. The animated emoticons were built using Apple Memoji, Tenor (GIF search engine) and Microsoft Powerpoint.

The final video can be seen here:
[![](https://res.cloudinary.com/marcomontalbano/image/upload/v1613869761/video_to_markdown/images/google-drive--1f4OqlMdtny6A5Mg1j8a80tQPo764M6_b-c05b58ac6eb4c4700831b2b3070cd403.jpg)](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1f4OqlMdtny6A5Mg1j8a80tQPo764M6_b "")

While the interaction showcases responses to an email, HoloSent's use case can be expanded well outside emails, to private messaging and blogs too (as suggested by Sam Lee). 

The use of reflection to project images restricts the lighting when using this device. We hope that we can come up with a technique in future iterations that will allow us to create the image projections in a well-lit room.
